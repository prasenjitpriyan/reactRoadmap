# React

- React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.
- It is a library to build interactive web application.
- React was released in May 2013
- One of the most favorite library for build web and mobile application.

## Why to choose React?

Today Reacts popularity has overtaken all other front-end development framework and the most obviously reasons are easy production of dynamic online applications so React makes it easier to create dynamic web application by requiring less coding and providing more functionality as opposed to javascript which can quickly become difficult.

## improved performance

React makes advantage of virtual dom to speed up the development of web pages instead of updating all the components again and again virtual dom analysis their prior state and only update the things in the real dom that have changed that has significantly improved the speed of the apps that has designed not React.

## Reusable Components

Reusable components are the foundation of any React application and most apps have numerous component which have their own logic and controls. They may have reused across the project reducing development time.

## Uni-directional Data Flow

The data flow in React is uni-directional as a result developer frequently nest child component within parent components when developing a react app because data flow in a single path debugging folds and determining where the problem arise in application at in any given time becomes easier.

## Architecture (MVC)

- M - Model
- V - View
- C - Controller

So React is the view in this model view controller architecture responsible for how the application appears and feel so mvc is an architectural pattern that split the application layer into model view and controller. So the model relates to all data related logic. So the view is used for UI logic and the controller is an interface between the model and the view part of your application.

## Packages

- The term "package" refers to code that has been made public.
